# data-insight-mini-reports
A collection of three mini data analysis projects exploring customer churn prediction, comparative drug efficacy, and commuting emissions estimation.

# Data Insight Mini Reports

This repository contains three exploratory data analysis and modeling projects focused on diverse real-world datasets. Each project applies statistical and machine learning methods to uncover insights, visualize trends, and communicate findings effectively.


## üîç Projects Included

### 1. Predicting Customer Attrition (Bank Churn)
- **Goal**: Build predictive models to identify customers likely to churn from a bank.
- **Techniques**: EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, and supervised learning (Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting).
- **Outcome**: Random Forest model achieved the lowest misclassification rate (~3.7%) with top features identified.
- **Files**: R Markdown, output HTML

### 2. Blood Pressure Drug Effectiveness
- **Goal**: Assess the comparative effectiveness of Lisinopril, Moexipril, and Ramipril in reducing systolic blood pressure.
- **Techniques**: ANCOVA, permutation tests, residual diagnostics.
- **Outcome**: Moexipril showed greatest average reduction, but Ramipril was significantly less effective. Small sample size (n=12) limits generalization.
- **Files**: `bloodpressurestudy.csv`, R file, output HTML

### 3. Estimating Annual Commuting Emissions (Miami University)
- **Goal**: Estimate total weekly and annual commuting mileage, fuel use, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions for faculty/staff and students in FY23.
- **Techniques**: Address geocoding, distance estimation, CO‚ÇÇ conversion, error estimation via standard errors.
- **Context**: Supports sustainability initiatives from the University Climate Action Plan.
- **Files**: Cleaned data files (`students.csv`, `employees.csv`), slides, report
